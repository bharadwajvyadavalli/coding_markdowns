# Coding Problems Solutions

## Two Number Sum

### üß† Problem Summary
Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target. Return the indices of these numbers.

**Constraints:**
- Each input has exactly one solution
- Cannot use the same element twice
- Return indices in any order

**Examples:**
- `[2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9` ‚Üí `[0, 1]` (2 + 7 = 9)
- `[3, 2, 4], target = 6` ‚Üí `[1, 2]` (2 + 4 = 6)

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Use a hash map to store complements. For each number, check if its complement (target - current) exists in the map. If found, return both indices.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - hash map storage

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Hashing** - Using a hash map for O(1) lookups to find complements efficiently.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(array):
        complement = targetSum - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

## Validate Subsequence

### üß† Problem Summary
Given two arrays, determine if the second array is a subsequence of the first. A subsequence means elements appear in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.

**Constraints:**
- Both arrays are non-empty
- Subsequence elements must appear in order

**Examples:**
- `[5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], [1, 6, -1, 10]` ‚Üí `True`
- `[5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], [22, 25, 6]` ‚Üí `True`
- `[5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], [1, 6, -1, 11]` ‚Üí `False`

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Use two pointers: one for the main array, one for the subsequence. Traverse the main array and advance the subsequence pointer when matches are found.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through main array
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - constant extra space

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Two Pointers** - Using pointers to track progress through both arrays simultaneously.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)

def isValidSubsequence(array, sequence):
    seq_idx = 0
    for value in array:
        if seq_idx == len(sequence):
            break

- `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]` ‚Üí `[0, 1, 1, 4, 4]`

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Use two pointers from both ends since the largest squares will come from the most negative or most positive numbers. Compare squares and fill result array from right to left.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - new result array

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Two Pointers** - Using pointers from both ends to handle negative numbers efficiently.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def sortedSquaredArray(array):
    result = [0] * len(array)
    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1
    
    for i in range(len(array) - 1, -1, -1):
        if abs(array[left]) > abs(array[right]):
            result[i] = array[left] ** 2
            left += 1
        else:
            result[i] = array[right] ** 2
            right -= 1
    
    return result

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Hashing** - Using a hash map to efficiently track and update team scores.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def tournamentWinner(competitions, results):
    scores = {}
    best_team = ""
    best_score = 0
    
    for i, (home, away) in enumerate(competitions):
        winner = home if results[i] == 1 else away
        scores[winner] = scores.get(winner, 0) + 3
        
        if scores[winner] > best_score:

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Sort the array first. For each coin, if it's greater than the current change + 1, then current change + 1 is the answer. Otherwise, add the coin to the current change.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - sorting dominates
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - constant extra space

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Greedy Algorithm** - Making locally optimal choices (using smallest coins first) to find the global solution.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python

**Time Complexity:** O(m*n) - must visit each element once
**Space Complexity:** O(m*n) - new matrix storage

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Matrix Manipulation** - Swapping dimensions and reorganizing elements systematically.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python

## Find Three Largest Numbers

### üß† Problem Summary
Given an array of integers, return the three largest numbers in sorted order.

**Constraints:**
- Array has at least 3 integers
- Return in ascending order

**Examples:**
- `[141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27, 18, 541, 8, 7, 7]` ‚Üí `[18, 141, 541]`

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Use three variables to track the three largest numbers. For each element, update the three largest if necessary.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - constant extra space

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Linear Scan** - Maintaining running maximums while traversing the array once.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def findThreeLargestNumbers(array):
    threeLargest = [float('-inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf')]
    
    for num in array:
        updateLargest(threeLargest, num)
    
    return threeLargest

def updateLargest(threeLargest, num):
    if num > threeLargest[2]:
        shiftAndUpdate(threeLargest, num, 2)
    elif num > threeLargest[1]:
        shiftAndUpdate(threeLargest, num, 1)
    elif num > threeLargest[0]:
        shiftAndUpdate(threeLargest, num, 0)

def shiftAndUpdate(array, num, idx):
    for i in range(idx + 1):
        if i == idx:
            array[i] = num
        else:
            array[i] = array[i + 1]
```

## Bubble Sort

### üß† Problem Summary
Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm. Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order.

**Constraints:**
- Sort in ascending order
- Modify array in-place

**Examples:**
- `[8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]` ‚Üí `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]`

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
Use nested loops. Outer loop tracks sorted portion, inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps if needed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) - nested loops
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - in-place sorting

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Bubble Sort** - Repeatedly swapping adjacent elements to "bubble" larger elements to the end.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def bubbleSort(array):
    isSorted = False
    counter = 0
    
    while not isSorted:
        isSorted = True
        for i in range(len(array) - 1 - counter):
            if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
                array[i], array[i + 1] = array[i + 1], array[i]
                isSorted = False
        counter += 1
    
    return array

**Examples:**
- `[8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]` ‚Üí `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]`

### ‚ö° Optimal Strategy
For each element starting from index 1, insert it into the correct position in the sorted portion to its left.

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) - worst case, but O(n) for nearly sorted arrays
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - in-place sorting

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Insertion Sort** - Building sorted array incrementally by inserting each element in its correct position.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def insertionSort(array):
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        j = i
        while j > 0 and array[j] < array[j - 1]:
            array[j], array[j - 1] = array[j - 1], array[j]
            j -= 1
    
    return array
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) - always quadratic regardless of input
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - in-place sorting

### üîç Pattern/Technique
**Selection Sort** - Repeatedly selecting the minimum element and placing it in the correct position.

### ‚úÖ Clean Code (Python)
```python
def selectionSort(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        minIdx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):
            if array[j] < array[minIdx]:
                minIdx = j
        
        if minIdx != i:
            array[i], array[minIdx] = array[minIdx], array[i]
    
    return array
```

    while left < right:
        while left < right and not string[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not string[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        
        if string[left].lower() != string[right].lower():
            return False
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
